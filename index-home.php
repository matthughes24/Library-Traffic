            The Digital Library allows you to look through the library from online. To use it simply click the link on the nav bar, 
            choose the floor you want to view and then you should see the bookcases. From there you can click to see each shelf.

            The Locate a Book function allows you to search for the location of a book. To use this function input the call number of the book you're
            looking for and then a red bar should show up on the correct bookcase.

            Robot
        </h5>
        <p>
            This function is coming soon. The robot's function is to look through the shelves of the library and read the labels of the books to
            see if any of them are out of place. If an out of place book is found then it's location is indicated on the map.
